On the contrary, people are selling large-cap equities. Austin believes that this seems to be a bit of a reactionary trading activity.\nCNBC, while highlighting the comments made by Venu Krishna (Barclays head of U.S. equity strategy), reported that there remains sufficient capacity for the retail investors to further disengage from the broader equity market. Notably, Barclays\u2019 proprietary euphoria indicator exhibited that the sentiments are down to the levels that were seen around the time of the US election back in November, but remain elevated by historic standards. \u00a0The increased sell-off came as American households remained more sensitive than ever to the significant volatility in the broader equity markets.\nTo list the 8 Best Robinhood Stocks to Buy According to Analysts, we sifted through several online rankings to shortlist the stocks trending on Robinhood.

Since the company's initial public offering in 2002, shares have skyrocketed, rising 80,080% (as of March 19). This means that if you invested a small sum of just $1,250 back then, you would be sitting on a seven-figure balance today from this single investment. That's an unbelievable outcome.\nNetflix's market cap today exceeds $400 billion. But the business is surely still on the radar for many investors looking to put some money to work over the long haul.\nIf you buy this top streaming stock today, can it help you retire as a millionaire? I believe it's important to learn what makes this company special before deciding if it should be in your portfolio.\nInvestors need to understand the company's scale. Netflix raked in $39 billion in revenue in 2024. That was up 16% year over year and 609% higher than a decade ago. \nIt counted 302 million subscribers as of Dec. 31. Again, this key metric has increased rapidly over the years. At the end of 2014, there were 57 million customers. \nPerhaps no factor has contributed more to Netflix's impressive ascent than its first-mover advantage. It was able to gain members and grow revenue rapidly because it was primarily competing against traditional cable TV and providing a superior experience. Of course, the competitive landscape has shifted, but the company is still in the lead.\nAnd it's easy to be optimistic. According to data from Nielsen, the streaming platform represented 8.2% of daily TV viewing time in the U.S. in February, behind only YouTube. Engagement will remain strong, especially with new seasons of incredibly popular shows Squid Game, Wednesday, and Stranger Things coming out in 2025.\nThe company's monster success in the streaming industry has become more apparent in the past few years, particularly as competing services have entered the market in an attempt to gain customers and scale up. This couldn't be more obvious when you look at profitability, something Netflix excels at these days.\nIt has such a large revenue and subscriber base that its bottom line has exploded. The company's operating margin went from 13% in 2019 to 27% last year, with executives targeting 29% in 2025. Its scalability is showing up right before our eyes.\nThe company operates a fixed-cost business model; serving every additional user has minimal marginal costs, as is typically the case with digital services. In theory, content costs don't need to grow year to year, at least in lockstep with sales gains. So, by adding more subscribers and increasing revenue, earnings have soared. This trend has also been supported by occasional price hikes.\nOver the next three years, consensus analyst estimates call for diluted earnings per share to rise at a compound annual rate of 22.6%. This is in line with the past three years.\nAs mentioned previously, Netflix has historically been a wonderful stock to own. This has now become a dominant media and entertainment company.\nUnfortunately, the shares aren't cheap. Although they're down 9% from their peak in February, they trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 38.6. This is far from a bargain, and it's a premium to the trailing-two-year average. Consequently, I don't believe the shares make for a smart buy today, even though they could still rise in the years ahead.\nGetting to the question of whether the stock can help you retire a millionaire, I think two crucial factors are at play. If you have a very long time horizon and are able to invest a bigger sum up front, then the chances are greater. Just don't expect a repeat of past returns.\n Moreover, investors shouldn't hope that a single stock can get them to the promised land. Diversification is the best path to lasting investing success.\nBefore you buy stock in Netflix, consider this:\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\u00a010 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Netflix wasn\u2019t one of them.

Netflix doesn't even report it in the same detail it used to, and management stopped providing forward-looking guidance for subscriber growth in 2023. In next month's first-quarter 2025 report, Netflix won't even report membership counts or average revenue per member anymore.\nThose old-school favorite metrics just don't reflect Netflix's business goals these days. The official focus in January's Q4 2024 report -- and going forward -- was threefold:\nSustain healthy revenue growth\nExpand operating margin\nGrow free cash flow\nAmong these three core targets, revenue growth comes closest to the former focus on subscriber additions. But in the long run, Netflix should be valued by its free cash flows, making this the most relevant financial metric to watch.\nNetflix stock recently set a new all-time high, but the company isn't really delivering on its stated goals -- yet.\nFree cash flows rose sharply in 2022 and 2023, but held almost perfectly firm in 2024. These cash profits actually fell 13% year over year in the all-important holiday quarter of 2024. The full-year figure held steady at $6.9 billion.\nBut Netflix shares rose 13% in the next two days anyway, because management's guidance pointed to 13% revenue growth in 2025 (healthy revenue growth) along with an operating margin increase of 2 percentage points (expand operating margin) and roughly 16% richer free cash flows (grow free cash flow).\nGranted, these are forward-looking statements and many things can go wrong along the way, but investors embraced Netflix's optimistic outlook on the most important numbers. You should get used to watching these three crucial Netflix metrics -- especially the free-cash-flow figure -- as the media-streaming veteran continues growing in a game-changing way.\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?
